# Hand-Drawn Image Classification Project

## Overview

Our project aims to tackle the challenge of accurately classifying hand-drawn images into predefined categories. Hand-drawn images present unique challenges in classification due to variations in style, stroke, and quality, making traditional image classification techniques less effective. The goal of this project is to overcome these challenges and develop a robust classification system capable of reliably recognizing hand-drawn sketches.

## Approach

To achieve our objective, we explore various image enhancement techniques such as denoising, contrast enhancement, filtering, and CLAHE image processing. Additionally, we implement feature extraction methods including corners, edges, and  HIstogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) to capture key characteristics of hand-drawn sketches.

Furthermore, we leverage data augmentation techniques such as rotation and horizontal flipping to increase the diversity of our training dataset.

## Classification Models

Through the implementation of classical machine learning models for classification such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines(SVM). We also tried boosting methods like Adaboost and XGBoost. Apart from these we also leverage Deep Learning methods using Simple MLP and Xception model. We aim to develop a comprehensive understanding of the performance of these models on hand-drawn image classification tasks. By evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of each model, we seek to identify the most suitable approach for our classification problem.

## Conclusion

This project represents an exploration into the realm of computer vision and machine learning, with the ultimate goal of building a robust system capable of accurately classifying hand-drawn sketches, thereby addressing the inherent challenges posed by these types of images.# CV_Project
